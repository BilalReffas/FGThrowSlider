FGThrowSlider
=============

iOS drop-in control giving you the iOS 7.1 brightness/volume style slider with a dynamic fadeout animation. 

Simply copy over the FGThrowSlider.h and FGThrowSlider.m files into your project, create a new instance like so:  
  `FGThrowSlider *slider = [[FGThrowSlider alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(50, 50, 200, 20)];`  
and then add it to your view:  
  `[view addSubview:slider];`  
  
Feel free to use it in your projects and let me know of any ideas, requests, stuff.
